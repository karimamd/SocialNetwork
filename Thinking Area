added a new table called FriendRequest with ids of sender and receiver
and State attribute With default value 0 (pending request)
1 for (Refused) and 2 for (Accepted)

currently thinking of a proper way to accept and refuse friendRequests
learned that form can send post and get superglobals to send state accepted or refused
to a page which has a function that acts upon answer but I need to send ID of friend
and my ID too to be able to do this opereation
I can send my ID through a session variable
I but how can I send my friend's ID

I used to send state in the "value" attribute of an input
and get the value of the the form of name x

but now I can't send that ID which is a PHP variable in html or can I ?

I also failed to make this in the same page or else I would probably need ajax

I cannot send ID of friend through session because I show data by iteration so
session will be updated each time until it reaches last ID in friendRequests
but button won't be specific to this friend

one last solution will be to make accept and refuse buttons on the requested profile only
if everything else didn't work
